I have a further armor-related question
if you give your guy armor with Aged Sensei, and then attack with it and the opponent's tower pings the armor
off, and /then/ you cast Art of War and gain two more armor, do you still lose one immediately at the end of your
turn?

/* you have 1 gold, a gilded glaxx with a lethal amount of -1 runes being kept alive by its ability, a  flying unit
with 1 hp, and a wandering mimic.

they have maxband orpal on patrol and setsuki in backline. you declare that you're attacking setsuki with the flying
mimic, so you pay your last gold. glaxx dies, -1 rune from orpal's maxband spreads to the 1hp flier, killing it.
wandering mimic loses flying and is now "illegally" attacking setsuki past the patrolling orpal

/*
Hotter fire says that it doesnt increase sparkshot damage becuase although its an ability it's is combat damage
Sentry prevents the first ability damage done to a patroller and does work on spark shot
both use the same wording for this
 */

// if you have smoker + dreamscape, I guess active player chooses bounce vs. death

/*
If you fly over a patroller which has anti-air but not swift strike, and after swift strike damage is dealt it no longer has anti-air, does it still deal damage?
i think yes, anti-air gets locked in after 2 choose defender
the reasoning was that otherwise its sorta undefined whether youre using flying to bypass things (since you could be attacking illegally)

Question. Wandering mimic gets sparkshot from a hero, when killing that hero do they still get to do 1 to the adjacent patroller?

Yes, combat damage is all dealt at once

// second chances can save hardened mox from its own trash effect but it immediately trashes itself again?

// If you Manufactured Truth something into a Mirror Illusion, Quince can turn it into a copy of something else and
// force it to be trashed at end of turn, but it's not a token, so Second Chances can save it ... ?

// Trashing something with Geiger's maxband doesn't let Second Chances do anything but does use up the trigger?
